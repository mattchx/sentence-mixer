- required to create a 2d array to store the whether each letter has been guessed correctley already

### Done
- - have 3 variables: one scrambled sentence string, one original 2d sentence array, and one sentence string


Issues
- updating a 2d Array using a counter once the correct letter is inputed eg[[[s,true],[i,true]], [[n,false],[a,false]]]
- managing useEffect to minimze re-renders from keyboard input
